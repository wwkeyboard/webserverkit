# Web Server Kit

Some people learn best by doing, and this site is for those
people. This site is intended for two groups of people, those who have
been through an language's introductory tutorial and are looking for
project to tackle next, and those who want a better understanding of
how the web works. We'll walk through the process of discovering how
HTTP works and what technologies underpin modern websites.

This guide is language agnostic, we'll talk about protocols and
specifications instead of libraries. This means you'll need to do a
significant amount of research outside of this guide to complete the
projects. This is intentional. If you are trying to learn a new
language this is a great way to become familiar with the docs of that
language. The decision of what libraries above and beyond the standard
lib of the language will be up to you, remember the point is both to
learn about the language as well as web sites. You could easily `gem
install rails` and get on with your life, but that's not the point of
this guide.
