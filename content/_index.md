# Web Server Kit

The web is important, it's in everyone's lives. I don't think enough
people understand how it really works, how the bits are actually put
together. This project will guide you through building a simple web
server. It won't be complete or production ready, but you can learn a
bunch along the way.

This site will be useful to at least two groups of people. First are
those who want a better understanding of how the web works. If you
have only built web applications using a framework or set of libraries
this will teach you what underpins those tools. It won't replace those
tools but you'll be much better equipped to use them and possibly even
contribute back!

The second group are programmers who are learning a new language. Once
you've worked through the language's introductory tutorial you'll
probably be looking for a project to try in that language. If this is
your first programming language be warned that you'll be digging into
the documentation of that language and you'll have to answer questions
for yourself(with a significant helping hand from Google). This is an
essential skill for a professional software developer and you should
practice it.

This guide is language agnostic, we'll talk about protocols and
specifications instead of libraries. This means you'll need to do a
significant amount of research outside of this guide to complete the
project, this is intentional. If you are trying to learn a new
language this is a great way to become familiar with the docs of that
language. The decision of what libraries above and beyond the standard
lib of the language is up to you. I'd recommend you stay with the
standard library where possible. You could easily `gem install rails`
and get on with life, but that's not the point of this guide.

The tools used in this guide will be linux specific, you can follow
along on other operating systems by you may need to make some slight
adjustments to the command arguments. Think of it as another
learning opportunity :-)

I have a few hints for this project: it's not a school assignment,
it's not a paid contract, and it's not work for an employer, you are
welcome to complete each segment in as much detail as you would
like. No one is going to blame you if you don't use the perfect
solution to everything. You don't even have to write unit tests if you
don't want to! Although if you've never used test driven development
this would be a great project to give TDD a try. Just don't pile to
many new things on at once, you can always work through it a second
time learning something new.

I HEREBY GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO MAKE MISTAKES, explore, make
questionable design choices, delete code, refactor everything, shave
any yaks you want, whatever you want to do with your project is
okay. Please, this is how we learn!

In each section I'll try to include some googleable words to help you
in the right direction if you get stuck. A lot of these will be of the
format "{ your language } some term", so I'll use those brackets to
signify that the search should be language specific.

This is broken up into segments that should build on each other. Some
people may be able to skim over the description and get right to the
tasks. Others may take more time, and that's fine. It doesn't matter
if this takes you an hour or a week; it's your project to
complete how you see fit.
